### What I learned

In this project I tried to use CSS validators to clean my CSS code and to learn the industry best practices. I also start to use "className" properties in my jsx to impart class to the JSX elements.

### Continued development

Since I'm new in React, I will try to incorporate React and learn their best practices in my next projects. I will also try to simplify my CSS code to make the file size smaller.
